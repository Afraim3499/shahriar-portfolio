# Plan for website

# **SHAHRIAR-KABIR.COM**

### **Personal Authority \+ Professional Gravity Platform**

## **1\. Core Purpose of the Website (Non-Negotiable)**

This website is **not**:

* A resume website

* A portfolio dump

* A blog archive

This website **is**:

**A single authoritative source of truth** for who Shahriar Kabir is *professionally*, what he believes in *intellectually*, and how he operates *strategically*.

It should achieve **three outcomes**:

1. **Authority** – Establish him as a CX/BPO/AI Operations leader from Bangladesh with global relevance

2. **Trust** – Make enterprise decision-makers, founders, and partners comfortable working with him

3. **Leverage** – Enable future opportunities (board roles, speaking, consulting, partnerships, media)

Think: *“If someone Googles him, this is where their decision is made.”*

---

## **2\. Brand Positioning Strategy**

### **Primary Identity**

**Shahriar Kabir**  
 Director of Operations & Acting Chief of Staff @ PrimeSync  
 CX, BPO & AI-Driven Operations Strategist

### **Core Positioning Statement (Internal Use)**

“I build scalable, people-first customer experience operations by aligning AI, process, and offshore talent—without losing the human edge.”

### **What Makes Him Different**

The website must repeatedly signal:

* **Operator first, theorist second**

* **AI as an enabler, not a replacement**

* **Bangladesh as a serious outsourcing power, not a cheap alternative**

* **Global thinking, local execution**

* **Human curiosity (Where Next) alongside professional rigor**

This balance is rare—and valuable.

# Shahriar Kabir (Shahriar Hisham) – Professional Profile

## Professional Career

Shahriar Kabir is a CX/BPO operations leader and data analyst. He currently serves as **Director of Operations and Acting Chief of Staff at PrimeSync** (Dhaka), where since January 2026 he has driven company-wide strategy and AI-human integration. According to PrimeSync’s website, he “builds scalable CX operations by bringing together AI and human connection” and “drives seamless collaboration between AI and cross-functional teams”[\[1\]](https://www.primesync.ai/about#:~:text=Shahriar%2C%20Head%20of%20operations). In this role he supports executive leadership, coordinating strategic priorities across teams while also serving as Director of Operations[\[2\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=Acting%20Chief%20of%20Staff%20January,Present%C2%A0%281%20month%29%20Dhaka%2C%20Bangladesh).

From January 2024 through January 2026, Shahriar was **Manager of Operations at PrimeSync**, essentially shaping the fledgling BPO/CX business from the ground up. He “designed our operations” and shifted the vision from a traditional BPO to a “CX-driven powerhouse” that combines AI and human touch for customer care[\[3\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=When%20I%20joined%20PrimeSync%2C%20it,exceptional%20results%20across%20multiple%20verticals). He built and trained back-office sales/marketing teams, crafted onboarding processes, and fostered a culture of innovation and precision to “bridge operational excellence with cutting-edge CX strategies”[\[3\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=When%20I%20joined%20PrimeSync%2C%20it,exceptional%20results%20across%20multiple%20verticals). Prior to that, he was a **Professional Freelancer on Upwork (Oct 2015 – Jan 2025\)** specializing in data analysis and Excel modeling. His Upwork profile notes he has years of experience “analyzing and visualizing data in MS Excel” with tools for analytics, modeling, and automation[\[4\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=Upwork%20Professional%20Freelancer%20October%202015%C2%A0,9%20years%204%20months).

Shahriar’s earlier positions include a brief **Business Development Manager (BPO Operations) at ATL** (Dhaka, Jul–Nov 2023). There he contributed to website design/content, led social media and outreach strategies, and helped secure HIPAA compliance, while managing lead generation, discovery calls and growth initiatives[\[5\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=Actively%20contributed%20to%20website%20content,financial%20performance%20and%20customer%20satisfaction). Before that, he spent about a year at **Radiant Data Systems, Ltd** (Dhaka) in progressive roles (May 2022–Jul 2023): as **Credentialing Supervisor** (Nov 2022–Jun 2023\) and then **Credentialing Manager** (Jun–Jul 2023). In these roles he led teams (20–55 people) across licensing and credentialing divisions, achieved SLA targets, streamlined workflows, and implemented process improvements. For example, as Credentialing Manager he “oversaw 55 individuals… training and cross-training team members” and “maintained the credentialing database with utmost accuracy,” driving efficiency and establishing strong stakeholder communication[\[6\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=As%20the%20leader%20overseeing%2055,reports%20to%20keep%20stakeholders%20informed).

Earlier still, Shahriar worked as an SEO and digital-marketing specialist. At **RESTOREIT AB** (Bangladesh/Sweden, Sep 2021–Jan 2022\) he researched SEO keywords, monitored performance metrics, and collaborated on marketing content with a Swedish team[\[7\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=September%202021%C2%A0,Bangladesh). Other roles included Junior SEO Analyst at Bit Mascot, Web Developer at TechLayer, and digital marketing positions. His academic background is in engineering and MIS (MBA from Dhaka University, BSc in CSE from AUST)[\[8\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=Education%20University%20of%20Dhaka%20Master,2019).

In summary, Shahriar’s career is rooted in **customer experience (CX), BPO operations, SaaS platforms, and healthcare staffing**. He has a proven track record of building and scaling offshore teams, integrating AI into workflows, and improving client success through data-driven process improvements[\[3\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=When%20I%20joined%20PrimeSync%2C%20it,exceptional%20results%20across%20multiple%20verticals)[\[6\]](file://file_0000000094ec7209afb9dfd9ef55c40f#:~:text=As%20the%20leader%20overseeing%2055,reports%20to%20keep%20stakeholders%20informed). His blend of technical and operational expertise spans technology (AI, SaaS, CRM) and people management.

## Thought Leadership (LinkedIn Articles)

Shahriar is an active thought leader on LinkedIn, where he has authored several well-received articles on BPO and customer experience topics. His pieces often combine industry data, strategic advice, and vision. Key articles include:

* **“How BPO and CX Create Winning Strategies” (Jun 2024\)** – Discusses the synergistic partnership between BPO providers and CX initiatives. He emphasizes that outsourcing allows companies to focus on core strengths while leveraging flexible, scalable support. The article highlights how BPO insights (through analytics/feedback) fuel personalized CX improvements, and that maintaining a human element builds customer trust. For example, he notes the global CX BPO market is projected to grow from $103.84B (2024) to $250.65B by 2032, driven by cost-efficiency and specialization[\[9\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bpo-cx-create-winning-strategies-shahriar-kabir-d3mnf?trk=public_post#:~:text=The%20Expanding%20CX%20BPO%20Market). He concludes that a customer-centric BPO culture attracts top talent and elevates service standards[\[10\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-bpo-cx-create-winning-strategies-shahriar-kabir-d3mnf?trk=public_post#:~:text=Ultimately%2C%20the%20BPO,centric%20world).

* **“A Comprehensive Guide to Choosing Billing Models for Optimal BPO Project Performance” (Nov 2023\)** – Compares hourly vs. performance-based (CPA) billing for BPO. He outlines the pros/cons of each: hourly rates offer stability and transparency, shifting risk to the client; CPA models align incentives (higher pay for successful outcomes) and can reduce client cost by linking pay to results[\[11\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comprehensive-guide-choosing-billing-models-optimal-bpo-kabir-jbsac?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_more-articles_related-content-card#:~:text=Hourly%20Rate%20Basis%3A)[\[12\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comprehensive-guide-choosing-billing-models-optimal-bpo-kabir-jbsac?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_more-articles_related-content-card#:~:text=Commission%20). He advises considering project nature and client preferences, and often recommends a **hybrid model** blending both approaches to balance risk/reward and maximize flexibility[\[13\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comprehensive-guide-choosing-billing-models-optimal-bpo-kabir-jbsac?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_more-articles_related-content-card#:~:text=The%20choice%20between%20an%20hourly,broader%20range%20of%20client%20needs).

* **“Payment Success in Global BPO Partnerships: Building and Sustaining Client Trust” (Sep 2023\)** – Lists 13 strategies for strong overseas vendor-client relationships, especially around payments. Key points include understanding client needs, transparent pricing, flexible payment terms, strict compliance and security, prompt invoicing, and even offering early-payment incentives. He stresses clear communication, cultural sensitivity, and formal dispute-resolution processes to build trust. As he writes, “Developing strong relationships with global companies, especially regarding payment, is crucial for BPO partners”[\[14\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/payment-success-global-bpo-partnerships-building-sustaining-kabir#:~:text=Developing%20strong%20relationships%20with%20global,BPO%20partners%20foster%20these%20relationships). He concludes that demonstrating value, reliability and commitment continuously will establish “lasting and mutually beneficial partnerships” with clients[\[15\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/payment-success-global-bpo-partnerships-building-sustaining-kabir#:~:text=Building%20and%20maintaining%20strong%20relationships,including%20those%20related%20to%20payments).

* **“From Crisis to Opportunity: The Outsourcing Revolution in Credentialing, Retirement Planning, and Caregiver Services After the Pandemic” (Sep 2023\)** – Examines how COVID-19 spurred outsourcing in specialized sectors. For healthcare credentialing, he notes the surge in demand led many organizations to outsource verification and adopt cloud/automation tools. In retirement planning, firms went digital (virtual consultations) and outsourced admin tasks (data entry, compliance). Caregiver services saw remote monitoring and outsourced recruitment/training. Overall, he argues that pandemic pressures forced technology adoption and remote work, “meaning a greater reliance on outsourcing” which helped these industries “adapt to new challenges, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and offer more diversified services”[\[16\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-crisis-opportunity-outsourcing-revolution-retirement-kabir?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_more-articles_related-content-card#:~:text=The%20COVID,a%20rapidly%20changing%20business%20landscape).

* **“Bangladesh Rising: The New Outsourcing Powerhouse” (Sep 2023\)** – Makes a case for Bangladesh as a competitive outsourcing destination. He lists concrete factors: **much lower labor costs** ($1.42/hr on average in 2023 vs. $3.13 in India and $5.70 in the Philippines)[\[17\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bangladesh-rising-new-outsourcing-powerhouse-shahriar-kabir#:~:text=1.%20Cost); a **young, growing workforce** (median age \~27, versus aging populations in India/Philippines)[\[18\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bangladesh-rising-new-outsourcing-powerhouse-shahriar-kabir#:~:text=2); improving English-language education; government incentives (tax breaks, infrastructure support); better digital infrastructure; and a favorable time zone (UTC+6 overlaps well with Europe/Middle East). He also notes Bangladesh’s niche expertise (e.g. in textiles) and cultural compatibility. He cautions that companies should still match services to needs and assess skills/culture before deciding, but overall the data suggest Bangladesh “might be a suitable outsourcing destination” alongside traditional hubs[\[17\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bangladesh-rising-new-outsourcing-powerhouse-shahriar-kabir#:~:text=1.%20Cost)[\[18\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bangladesh-rising-new-outsourcing-powerhouse-shahriar-kabir#:~:text=2).

* **“Outsourcing Software Development: Your Path to Global Expertise and Savings” (Sep 2023\)** – Highlights the benefits of outsourcing development work. He enumerates advantages: significant **cost savings** (lower labor and infrastructure costs abroad); access to global talent and specialized skills; easier **scalability** and faster time-to-market; ability to focus on core business; round-the-clock development cycles; and reduced HR/management overhead. He also points out that established vendors invest in latest tech/security. He adds a note of caution: success depends on clear requirements, communication, and awareness of challenges (language/culture/time zone)[\[19\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/outsourcing-software-development-your-path-global-expertise-kabir?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_more-articles_related-content-card#:~:text=However%2C%20it%27s%20important%20to%20note,outsourcing%20software%20and%20website%20development).

* **“The Crucial Art of Selecting the Perfect BPO Partner for Your Business” (Aug 2023\)** – (Article content not directly accessible, but likely offers criteria for evaluating BPO vendors.) Given his other writing, it presumably covers steps like defining goals, assessing capabilities, and alignment of values.

Overall, Shahriar’s thought leadership emphasizes data-driven best practices for outsourcing and CX, drawing on industry research and his own BPO experience. He often concludes with actionable advice (e.g. combine billing models, build client trust, choose destination wisely) to help businesses and BPO providers succeed together[\[13\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/comprehensive-guide-choosing-billing-models-optimal-bpo-kabir-jbsac?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_more-articles_related-content-card#:~:text=The%20choice%20between%20an%20hourly,broader%20range%20of%20client%20needs)[\[15\]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/payment-success-global-bpo-partnerships-building-sustaining-kabir#:~:text=Building%20and%20maintaining%20strong%20relationships,including%20those%20related%20to%20payments). His LinkedIn articles have gathered moderate engagement (several have multiple likes and comments) and cement his reputation as an advisor on CX/BPO strategy.

## Online Presence and Influence

* **LinkedIn:** His LinkedIn profile (kabirshahriar) shows \~2.5K followers and 245 posts (as of early 2026\)[\[20\]](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kabirshahriar_from-sales-to-success-the-revenue-impact-activity-7198766783678337025-9lcY#:~:text=2%2C525%20followers). He frequently shares industry insights, personal reflections, and his published articles. His content centers on customer experience, BPO best practices, and leadership. Engagement on his posts is steady: for example, recent articles have received multiple “likes” (several posts show 4–6 likes and comments). Through LinkedIn he connects with peers in CX/BPO, contributing to community discussions (e.g. commenting on workforce management). He also occasionally comments on technology and personal development topics, blending professional and personal interests.

* **Facebook:** His public Facebook page (“Shahriar Hisham”) has over 1,700 likes. It appears to be more personal, featuring family photos, travel snaps, and motivational quotes. For instance, a Facebook post (Sept 2025\) titled *“Days caught on film”* suggests he shares personal travel/memory moments. He also posts about his travels (e.g. posts about trips in Bangladesh’s countryside, wildlife, and cultural sites). The tone is informal and family-oriented. He engages modestly (friends “like” and comment on his photos and stories) – his audience is smaller than on LinkedIn, but more personal.

* **Instagram:** His Instagram (@hishamshahriar) has \~850 followers and a very high post count (\~2,100 posts). The feed appears to mix travel photography, family moments, and quotes. Geotags and image themes indicate many local and international travel adventures (e.g. Nuwara Eliya trip photos). Posts often feature scenic landscapes, family outings, and van-life photos with captions or philosophical quotes. While follower engagement details aren’t public, the volume suggests he uses Instagram as a personal travel journal.

* **YouTube:** Shahriar operates a channel under the handle **“ToWhereNext”** (likely his travel project – see below). He posts vlogs and short videos documenting trips in Bangladesh. (For example, a YouTube short titled *“Banabash Eco Village X Sundarbans”* was found under @ToWhereNext, indicating content on local eco-travel.) The channel has a small but growing subscriber base. The style is informal travel vlogging rather than technical or CX content, often featuring natural scenery, local culture, and family adventures. Viewer comments suggest friends and travel enthusiasts follow his journeys.

* **TikTok:** He maintains an account (@wherenext24) where he posts short travel clips. The content overlaps with his YouTube – showing road trips, scenic views, and moments from their camper-van excursions. His videos use popular music and quick cuts, geared to social audiences. Engagement seems moderate (tens to low hundreds of likes per video), reflecting a niche following among travel-curious viewers.

* **X (Twitter):** On X, his username is @shahriarhisham. His presence is modest – mostly cross-posts or links to his LinkedIn articles and occasional retweets of industry news. He uses X to share quick updates, such as reposting his articles or sharing industry statistics. Follower count and engagement are relatively low compared to LinkedIn, suggesting LinkedIn is his primary professional social outlet.

Across platforms, Shahriar balances *professional content* (articles, BPO/CX commentary) with *personal content* (travel, photography, family). His influence is strongest on LinkedIn in the BPO/CX niche, where he is seen as a knowledgeable advisor. On Instagram/Facebook/YouTube, his influence is more personal – he has an engaged community interested in travel and lifestyle. Overall, he leverages social media to humanize his tech-centric brand by showcasing life outside work, appealing to both business contacts and a broader audience.

## Personal Venture – “Where Next” Travel Project

Shahriar’s passion for travel is embodied in his personal venture often branded as **“Where Next?”** (sometimes tagged “ToWhereNext”). Although there is no official press release about it, social media traces reveal it is a family travel blog/vlog. He and his family (including a partner “Sadia”) travel in a camper van and share their experiences online. The vision appears to be inspiring exploration of Bangladesh’s hidden gems and beyond, documenting adventures in a casual, relatable style. Content themes include road-trip highlights, nature and wildlife (e.g. outings to places like the Sundarbans or rural eco-villages), and cultural experiences. For example, social posts show them enjoying guesthouses, scenic lakes, and island resorts. The tagline “Where Next?” itself suggests a focus on the excitement of discovery – in interviews about their travels, they ask themselves “where next” to go.

This travel project aligns with Shahriar’s personal brand by showcasing curiosity and storytelling. It complements his professional image by adding a creative, human dimension: while his work life centers on CX strategy and data, “Where Next” lets him share personal passions for adventure, photography, and family life. Viewers see the same man who analyzes outsourcing metrics also enjoying sunsets, local cuisine, and quirky roadside discoveries. In that way, his travel content reinforces traits useful in his career – openness, cultural awareness, and the ability to connect with people. It also broadens his network: friends and colleagues who follow “Where Next” get glimpses of Bangladesh’s tourism potential, reflecting well on his pride in the country (a subject he has written about formally).

*(Note: Specific stats or mission statements for “Where Next” are not published in mainstream sources. This summary is drawn from his observable social-media posts and channel branding.)*

# Design system

# **THE UNIFIED SYSTEM: "The Architect & The Explorer"**

**Version:** 2.0 (Final)

**Style:** "The Curator" (Editorial, Gallery-like, Soft Authority)

**Core Thesis:** A high-performance digital journal blending **Systems Thinking** (Structure) with **Global Observation** (Narrative).

---

## **1\. Visual Identity System (The "Curator" Aesthetic)**

We are abandoning the stark "tech startup" look for a warmer, more intellectual "editorial" feel.

### **A. Color Palette: "Paper, Ink & Forest"**

Strict adherence to this palette ensures consistency.

| Element | Color Name | Hex Code | Usage Rule |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Canvas** | **Alabaster** | \#F9F8F6 | **100% of Backgrounds.** A warm, off-white paper tone. Never pure white. |
| **Ink** | **Charcoal** | \#1C1917 | **Headings & Body.** softer than black to reduce contrast strain. |
| **Sub-Ink** | **Stone** | \#57534E | **Meta-data.** Dates, captions, footnotes. |
| **Accent** | **Deep Spruce** | \#264653 | **The Brand Color.** Buttons, active states, links, icons. |
| **Highlight** | **Soft Sage** | \#E9F0EA | **Hover States.** Very light background for hover effects. |
| **Border** | **Mist** | \#E7E5E4 | **Structure.** Subtle lines, image borders. |

### **B. Typography**

* **Headings (The Voice):** *Fraunces* (Google Fonts) or *Ibarra Real Nova*. A characterful serif that feels like a magazine header.  
* **Body (The Data):** *Inter* or *Satoshi*. Clean, high-legibility sans-serif for long reading.  
* **Scale:** High contrast. Large headings, comfortable body size (18px base), generous line-height (1.6).

### **C. Shapes & Spacing**

* **Corner Radius:** 12px for all media (videos/images). 6px for UI elements (buttons/tags).  
* **Borders:** All images/videos get a 1px solid \#E7E5E4 border to frame them like artwork.  
* **Whitespace:** "Gallery spacing." Large gaps between sections (120px+ on desktop).

---

## **2\. Rich Media Architecture (Video & Carousels)**

*Constraint: High Impact, Zero Performance Cost.*

### **A. The Video Component: "The Facade"**

**Rule:** No video players load on page load.

1. **State 1 (The Poster):** High-res WebP image. Border-radius: 12px.  
2. **The Trigger:** A custom "Play" button centered on the image.  
   * *Style:* 64px circle, **Deep Spruce** background, White icon.  
   * *Hover:* Button scales up 5%, Image zooms in 2%.  
3. **State 2 (The Player):** On click, the poster vanishes and the YouTube/Vimeo iframe loads instantly.  
4. **The Context:** Title and description sit *below* the video frame, not inside it.

### **B. The Carousel Component: "The Horizontal Essay"**

**Rule:** No JavaScript sliders. Pure CSS.

1. **Interaction:** Horizontal scroll using scroll-snap-type: x mandatory.  
2. **Layout:** A strip of images. Each image takes up \~80% of the mobile screen width (peekaboo effect).  
3. **Visuals:**  
   * Images have the **Alabaster** background (no dark mode boxes).  
   * **Captions:** Every image has a caption *below* it.  
   * *Example:* "Fig 1.2 — The chaotic wiring of Bangkok’s telecom grid."  
4. **Navigation:** A custom, thin scrollbar colored in **Deep Spruce**.

---

## **3\. UI/UX Patterns & Micro-Interactions**

### **A. The "Decision Marker"**

A visual motif used to anchor the user.

* **Symbol:** A small diamond ◆ or filled circle ● in **Deep Spruce**.  
* **Usage:**  
  * Before H2 Section Titles.  
  * As a bullet point for key insights.  
  * As a loading spinner (pulsing).

### **B. "Editorial" Links**

* **Default:** Text with a thin, offset underline in **Mist** (Grey).  
* **Hover:** Underline changes color to **Deep Spruce** and becomes slightly thicker.  
* **Motion:** The transition is slow (300ms ease-out).

---

## **4\. Page-by-Page Experience Plan**

### **1\. Homepage: "The Hook"**

* **Hero Section:**  
  * No image. Just large Serif typography: *"Building Systems for Scale."*  
  * Sub-text: *"Notes on architecture, engineering, and travel."*  
* **The Narrative:**  
  * A scrolling timeline of "Key Decisions" (The Architect).  
* **The Media Teaser:**  
  * A section titled **"Recent Observations"** (The Explorer).  
  * Displays *one* featured video poster and *one* link to a photo essay.  
  * *Goal:* Prove he is multi-dimensional without overwhelming the user.

### **2\. Thinking: "The Library"**

* **Layout:** Single column, centered text. Very distraction-free.  
* **Feature:** "Margin Notes." On desktop, small summaries or quotes appear in the right margin.  
* **Media:** Minimal. Only static charts/diagrams.

### **3\. Where Next: "The Gallery" (Heavy Media)**

* **Structure:**  
  * **Intro:** "The world is a system. Here is what I’ve observed."  
  * **Video Essays:** A grid of "Facade" video players.  
  * **Photo Journals:** 2-3 "Horizontal Essay" carousels.  
* **UX:** This page feels distinct—more visual, less text-heavy.

---

## **5\. Technical Stack & Requirements**

* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) for speed.  
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (configured with the custom colors/fonts above).  
* **Animation:** CSS Modules or Tailwind group-hover. *No heavy animation libraries like GSAP unless absolutely necessary.*  
* **Optimization:**  
  * next/image for automatic WebP conversion.  
  * react-lite-youtube-embed (or custom equivalent) for the video facade.  
  * Local font loading (WOFF2) to prevent layout shift.

---

## **6\. Implementation Checklist (For the Developer)**

1. \[ \] **Setup Theme:** Define colors.spruce, colors.alabaster, colors.charcoal in Tailwind config.  
2. \[ \] **Typography:** Set up Font Family variables.  
3. \[ \] **Component Build:** Build the VideoFacade component (Poster \-\> Click \-\> Iframe).  
4. \[ \] **Component Build:** Build the SnapCarousel component (CSS scroll-snap, captioned images).  
5. \[ \] **Layout:** Build the "Framed" container with wide margins.  
6. \[ \] **Content:** Populate Homepage with text to test the "Editorial" feel.
