When I joined PrimeSync, it was a blank slate - a vision waiting to take shape. From the ground up, I’ve been instrumental in designing our operations, keeping pace with global standards across the US and the Philippines. Starting with a traditional BPO model, I played a pivotal role in reshaping our vision into a CX-driven powerhouse, now combining AI and human touch to deliver exceptional results across multiple verticals.

I’ve built and trained our back-office sales and marketing teams, aligning their efforts with the dynamic demands of our overseas counterparts. Whether it’s talent acquisition, policy development, or crafting seamless onboarding experiences, I ensure every team member is primed to meet and exceed client expectations.

My passion? Enhancing customer experiences. By developing a culture of innovation and precision, I’ve helped PrimeSync bridge operational excellence with cutting-edge CX strategies. The result? A team that doesn’t just meet benchmarks but redefines them, creating value and driving success in every engagement.

As Credentialing Supervisor at Radiant Data Systems, Ltd., I led a 20-member team across Licensing, School, and RCS divisions, forging strong collaborations with AMN Healthcare. I played a pivotal role in helping the team achieve SLA agreements for the Licensing and RCS departments, which eventually evolved into independent divisions due to their growing impact.

One of my key contributions was driving the Licensing team to tackle backlog files and streamline current workflows. This effort not only ensured complete control over procedures but also led to replacing AMN’s in-house employee with our high-performing team—an accomplishment that underscored our operational excellence.

By coordinating workflows, ensuring clear task delegation, and maintaining meticulous records, I helped the team stay aligned with organizational goals. My work went beyond managing day-to-day tasks—I focused on building a process-driven, efficient credentialing system that upheld compliance and set the foundation for sustainable success.
